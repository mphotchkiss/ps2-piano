## What I Learned: building complex systems from simple logical components

The following combined to create this project:
- decoder
- busses
- clock
- counter
- comparator
- shift register
- D flip flop
- divider
- synchronizer

## How To Use

This design was untested on hardware and merely developed as a proof of concept design. It can be tested in ModelSim. Please refer to the report.pdf document to see the testing.
